# UK Car Crash Severity Predictor
## Introduction:
This project explores machine learning approaches to predicting the severity of car crashes in the United Kingdom using a large-scale accident dataset. Road safety is a critical public concern, and by analyzing key factors such as road type, weather, speed limits, and time of day, we aim to uncover patterns that contribute to different crash outcomes. Our objective is to build a robust predictive model that can classify crash severity levels, offering insights into which features play the most significant role in accident outcomes.

Throughout the milestones, we follow a structured ML pipeline that starts with dataset exploration and preprocessing, then moves into feature engineering and visualization, and finally applies supervised and unsupervised learning models to evaluate performance. Through documenting each stage of this process, we provide our reasoning and methodology for tackling a real-world predictive modeling problem.
## Milestone 1:
#### In this milestone we indentfied an adequate data set for our goal we drafted an Abstract to layout our plans for building our model
[Milestone 1](milestone_1.md)

## Milestone 2:
#### In this milestone we first did data exploration which entailed detailed descriptions of the features in the data set and identification of our target feature. To further understand the relationships of our data we constructed some inital plots and correlation matrices. Finally we discussed and executed inital preprocessing plan.

## Milestone 3:
#### In this milestone, we finished any major preprocessing of our data. We then trained our first supervised learning model through Naieve Bayes and evaulated its preformance. Finally we compared our training and test error to determine if we was overfitting and discussed next steps.
