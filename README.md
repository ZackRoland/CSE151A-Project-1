In this milestone we first did data exploration which entailed detailed descriptions of the features in the data set and identification of our target feature. To further understand the relationships of our data we constructed some inital plots and correlation matrices. Finally we discussed and executed inital preprocessing plan.

## Milestone 3

[Corresponding Code](milestone_3.ipynb)

In this milestone, we finished any major preprocessing of our data. We then trained our first supervised learning model through Naieve Bayes and evaulated its preformance. Finally we compared our training and test error to determine if we was overfitting and discussed next steps.
